# Continuous Audio Overlay
A useful tool that enables the user to easily control audio volume, sources, and output devices. It is a Windows Forms application that has been developed using .NET framework 4.7.2.
It is especially useful to those that use remote desktop regularly, as it can become tiresome to always have to minimize all the remote desktop windows to adjust audio settings of the host machine.

## Features
- playing audio from various internet radio streams
- pausing, playing, and skipping songs on any music application that supports Windows Media Controls (YouTube, Spotify, foobar2000 and more)
- volume level control
- changing audio output devices (such as switching from headphones to speakers)
- appearing on top of other applications

The application is still under development, and it's possible that more features will be added in the future.
